- Connecting to databases
- Creating tables
- Inserting, updating, and deleting records
- Querying data
- Using Python's `sqlite3` and `mysql-connector` libraries

### Integration (with SMTP)
In this folder, I am learning how to integrate Python with external services, specifically using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send emails. Topics include:

- This is best part because I make the gemini to create the email with just subject of mail ðŸ˜Ž
-  Setting up an SMTP server
- Sending plain text and HTML emails
- Adding attachments
- Using the `smtplib` library

---

- Creating and managing threads
- Synchronization with locks
- Using the `threading` and `multiprocessing` libraries
- Understanding the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

---

### Regular Expressions
Here, I am exploring the power of regular expressions (regex) for pattern matching and text manipulation. Topics include:
- Basic regex syntax
- Using the `re` module
- Matching, searching, and replacing text


---

### Socket Programming
This folder contains examples of socket programming in Python, which is essential for network communication. Topics include:
- Creating TCP/IP sockets
- Create a chat app which was cool 
- Building a simple client-server application
- Handling multiple connections
- Using the `socket` library

---

### Web Scraping
In this folder, I am learning how to scrape data from websites using Python. Topics include:
-I also made a lot scripts to scarpe footbal and second-hand car data 
- Using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` libraries
- Parsing HTML and XML
- Extracting data from tables, lists, and other elements
- Handling dynamic content with `Selenium`

---

### CSV Files
This folder focuses on working with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files in Python. Topics include:
- Reading and writing CSV files
- Using the `csv` module
- Handling large CSV files
- Converting CSV data to other formats (e.g., JSON)

---

### Functions
Here, I am exploring the concept of functions in Python, which are essential for writing modular and reusable code. Topics include:
- Defining and calling functions

- Working with APIs

---

### JSON
In this folder, I am learning how to work with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data in Python. Topics include:
- Parsing JSON data
- Converting Python objects to JSON
- Using the `json` module
- Working with nested JSON structures

---

### List Comprehensions
This folder focuses on list comprehensions, a concise way to create lists in Python. Topics include:
- Basic list comprehensions
- Nested list comprehensions
- Using conditions in list comprehensions
- Practical examples and use cases

---

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
In this folder, I am exploring the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Topics include:
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation and abstraction
